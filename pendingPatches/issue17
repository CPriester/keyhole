I have a case where https service proxies requests to a back-end http service. 
The ProxyFilter enforces the use of same scheme by doing request.getScheme().
 In my case I just wrote my own filter, but it'd be a smarter design if users 
would be allowed to optionally also specify the protocol with domain name and 
only if it's not specified use the same protocol. So basically, in ProxyFilter 
something like: 

String url = server.getDomainName().startsWith("http") 
? server.getDomainName() 
: request.getScheme() + "://" + server.getDomainName();

// Or, more generic: if server.getDomainName.contains("://") ...
url += server.getPath() + uri;
